# What's new in C# 9.0

## Top-level statements
+ Quick start
+ Looks familiar to scripters
- No benefit for **real** projects

## Init only setters
+ Closes a gap in the feature set
+ Very cool for fans of parameterless constructors

## Records
+ You can get rid of a lot of boilerplate
- You lose some flexibility

## Target-typed new expressions
+ Cool, if you're a little lazy
- Starts new discussions about whether to use var

## Pattern matching enhancements
+ Very good readable syntax
- Only few use cases in daily business
